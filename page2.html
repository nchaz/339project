            <div class="sl 1">There aren't many holes in Winnipeg's lineup aside from their defense. With a strong top 6 presence, Winnipeg looks to disrupt Montreal's momentum early and show why their offense is one of the best in the league.</div>
            <div class="sl 2">With big games and big goals by Kotkaniemi and Suzuki in round 1, the Habs look to ride their momentum into their series with Winnipeg, a team who looked like they could be the favorite out of the North division after Toronto's collapse.</div>
            <div class="sl 3">With arguably two of the leagues best goalies going head to head in as early as the second round, it should be a battle of the goalies between the Habs and the Jets in what may come down to whichever team's goalie plays better advances.</div>

                With Montreal dominating game 1 to steal a win from the Jets at home, this doesn't come without a bad taste in the mouths of Habs fans when Scheifele throws a suspendable hit on Evans in the last minutes of the game. </p>

                In a very defense and goalie centric game on home ice for Winnipeg, they simply can't break Carey Price, who goes on to steal game 2 for Montreal with a hardfought 1-0 win.
