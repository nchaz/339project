        <div class="sl 1">We have not seen a team like this ever - being $18M over the salary cap helps though. While many like to jab at the Lightning for fielding an unfair hockey team, all is fair and Tampa has shown they are the team to beat. </div>
        <div class="sl 2">After a murky regular season that saw him struggle, Price has been "lightning" hot since his playoff debut. Who will win in the battle between sturdy goalie and firepower offense?</div>
        <div class="sl 3">They get by with a little help from their friends ... and who are better friends than Tampa Bay's third forward line. Barclay Goodrow, Blake Coleman, and Yanni Gourde have been red hot and they are not looking to slow anytime soon.</div>

            <p class="description">
                In game 1, the Lightning's heavy offense is no match for Weber, Petry, Chiarot, Edmundson and Price. Tampa takes a commanding win over Montreal on home ice and comes away with the first lead of the series.</p>

            <p class="description">
                All stays status quo for this Lightning team as the Canadiens do not seem to have any sort of answer to their high powered offense, their steady defense and their rock solid goalie. Tampa Bay takes this one 3-1.

            <p class="description">
               Game 3 sees much of the same if not worse for Habs fans, as Tampa Bay enters the building scoring two quick goals right off the drop of the puck. This would continue to be the story for the rest of the game as Tampa Bay swallows Monteeal 6-3.</p>

                Ladies and gents, we have overtime! Josh Anderson loves to do it himself, and this game it showed after he pushed himself off the boards to put a puck in back of Vasilevskiy. And just like that, we have a series.</p>

            <p class="description">
                What better way to end it for Tampa Bay than to shutout Montreal on home ice after their offense did much of the work these playoffs. Steven Stamkos and the Lightning win the Stanley Cup, and Montreal will have to regroup and come back another year.</p>
