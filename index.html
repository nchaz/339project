        <div class="sl 1">In past years, Toronto's top guys have always been held to minimal points in the playoffs. Will superstars of Tavares, Matthews, Marner, and Nylander be able to make a splash or will they die out come playoff time?</div>
        <div class="sl 2">With opening night approaching, the Habs decide to go with a more veteran lineup with Staal and Perry drawing in - will it be the right move to have Caufield and Kotkaniemi sit out of the lineup for game 1.</div>
        <div class="sl 3">Everyone knows the running joke that the Maple Leafs can never get it done in the playoffs. With multiple first round exits in the last few years for the Leafs, will the Toronto woes continue or will this finally be their year?</div>
